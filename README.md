# BookSenSei üìö - AI-Powered Book Recommendation App

Welcome to BookSenSei, a smart book recommendation engine that goes beyond keywords to find books based on the *meaning* and *vibe* of your query. Tell the Sensei what you're in the mood for, and get personalized recommendations powered by semantic search and modern AI.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Semantic Search:** Instead of just matching keywords, our AI understands the *meaning* behind your queries (e.g., "a lonely detective story in a rainy city").
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Filter results by minimum user rating to find high-quality reads.
* **Interactive UI:** A beautiful and responsive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS, featuring a reactive particle background and smooth animations.
* **Persistent State:** Your search results and settings are saved as you navigate through the app.
* **Dynamic "Buy" Links:** Find any recommended book on Amazon with a single click.

cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
```

#### **2. Set Up the Backend (Python)**
* Navigate to the backend folder:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
* Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

#### **4. Run the Application!**
You need to have **both terminals running** at the same time.
